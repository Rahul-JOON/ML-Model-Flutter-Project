The very first protype of app is ready with a not so bad UI but its lacking the "hash of files" section on the home page. Sill fair amount of work had to be doen to reach so far.

3 public libraries were incorporated to achieve the desired results, which were getting a list of installed apps and with permission accessing all the inbox messages on the phone.
